Stop wasting time and money â€” Slash helps you find the best deals online.
- Slash is an upcoming chrome extension and API that scrapes the most popular e-commerce websites to get the best deals on the searched items across these websites. 
- In a market where we are spoilt for choices, we often look for the best deals.  
- The ubiquity of internet access has leveled the retail playing field, making it easy for individuals and businesses to sell products without geographic limitation. In 2020, U.S. e-commerce sales, receiving a boost due to the COVID-19 pandemic, grew 44% and represented more than 21% of total retail sales, according to e-commerce information source Internet Retailer.
- The growth of e-commerce has not only changed the way customers shop, but also their expectations of how brands approach customer service, personalize communications, and provide customers choices.
- The growth of e-commerce has prompted cut throat competition amongst dealers, which is discernable through the price patterns for products of major market players. Price cuts are somewhat of a norm now and getting the best deal for your money can sometimes be a hassle (even while online shopping).
- This is what Slashed aims to reduce by giving you a easy to use, all in one place solution for finding the best deals for your products that major market dealers have to offer!
