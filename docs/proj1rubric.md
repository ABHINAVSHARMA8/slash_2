|----|--------|------|--------|
1| workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
2| but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|3|https://github.com/secheaper/slash/pulse|
3| Number of commits|3|https://github.com/secheaper/slash/pulse|
4| Number of commits: by different people|2|https://github.com/secheaper/slash/pulse|
5| Issues reports: there are **many**|3|https://github.com/secheaper/slash/issues|
6|  issues are being  closed|3|https://github.com/secheaper/slash/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+|
7| DOI badge: exists |3|https://github.com/secheaper/slash/blob/main/README.md|
8|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly|2 |in GH|
9|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |2||
10|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|3|https://github.com/secheaper/slash/blob/main/README.md#card_index_dividers-some-examples|
11|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|2||
12|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|2|https://github.com/secheaper/slash/blob/main/assets/demo.gif|
13| Use of version control tools|2||
14|Use of  style checkers |2|config files in GH showing your config|
15| Use of code  formatters. |2|config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|
16| Use of syntax checkers. |2|config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  |
17| Use of code coverage |2|config files in GH|
18| other automated analysis tools|2|config files in GH|
19| test cases exist|2|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the  code base|
20| test cases are routinely executed|2|e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
21| the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|2||
22| issues are discussed before they are closed|2|every issue is dicussed by all, then assigned to one appropriate person for closure|
23| Chat channel: exists|2|https://discord.com/channels/879343473940107264/879343474393096237|
24| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|2|if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
25| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|2||
26| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|2||
27| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|2||
28| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|2||
29| short release cycles | 2|(hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
